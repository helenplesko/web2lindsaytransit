    <h2>Public transit is very important, especially in a place like Lindsay, where Fleming College is located. Hundreds of international students navigate through the city every year, even in extreme weather conditions. 
Even though there are good public transit services available, there is not a proper way to access these services like using Google Maps. 
We, as students, have tried to make these services more accessible but due to time, skillsets, and course scope restrictions, there are still a lot of things that can be improved.</h2>

<h3>Future Considerations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Data acquisition can be done for updated data since the only available data was from 2020.</li>
	<li>A network can be created for the Lindsay Transit and Network Analysis can be used which will save ArcGIS credits for Routing.</li>
	<li>Tracking the live locations of buses can give up-to-date informations to the user.</li>
	<li>The City of Kawartha Lakes can make the updated dataset available in GeoHub with the added and removed bustops informations like they do on their webpage.</li>
	<li>Users can use the survey of our web solution to provide feedback for updates and their experiences so the designs can be customized and upgraded.</li>
	<li>The bus can use the GPS services so that the live updates can be incorporated into the web solution so that the users can track the status of the bus.</li>
	<li>Incorporate in the web solution more information about accessibility services. This may include buses that have bike racks, wheelchair ramps, or bus shelters.</li>
</ul>
