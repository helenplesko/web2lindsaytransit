	<h1>Our Solution<h1>

<div class="pageintro">
    <h2>After lots of trial and error, we have found that Esri's ArcGIS Experience Builder is the best technology for a user-friendly public web application that will help people living and visiting Lindsay, Ontario, navigate around the city via public transit. Here's our methodology to create our final solution:</h2>
</div>

<div class="builder">
	<h3>Step 1: Create an experience</h3>

	<p>Create an experience builder using the ArcGIS online component from the menu button. Click the Experience Builder app.</p>
	<img src="images/Template.png" alt="image of the experience builder">

	<p>Create a new Experience using the "Create New" button on the top righthand side.</p>
	<img src="images/template2.png" alt="creating a experience builder">

	<p>There will be many templates presented to you. Choose wisely for the application of your interest. In our case, we are creating a Transit application for Lindsay, so this application should be Map centric.</p>

	<h3>Step 2: Add data</h3>

	<p>Click on the map in the center of the screen, then add data from the "Select map" tab on the righthand side. 
		This enables users to add data from either ArcGIS Online or a local database.</p>
	<img src="images/template3.png" alt="Adding data">

	<p>After adding the data, you will see the stops and routes of the Lindsay transit in the application. 
		This routes features are what we created from the GTFS and Ontario GeoHub transit data.</p>
	<img src="images/template4.png" alt="Routes of Lindsay">
		<p> NOTE: Don't use the routing widget from the Experience builder as this requires credits and request per head. This is a useless function on this point.</p>

	<img src="images/route.png" alt="routing features">

	<p> This causes a error at the final product this is the screen shot of that which we coundn't make that work.</p>

	<img src="images/routing.png" alt="routing features">

	<h3>Step 3: Add splash page</h3>

	<p>In the editing interface of the Experience Builder, click the page icon on the upper lefthand side of the sidebar.
		Click Window to switch to viewing all the windows within the experience. Click the + icon on the window to add a window.
	</p>

	<p>Scroll down and choose your layout of choice of this window. I chose the Simple version.</p>
	
	<p>Add an image and text. On our splash page, we wanted to include an image of the routes and also text indicating what the purpose of the experience is. 
		Since this experience was for exploration purposes and the data needs some fine tuning, we added a disclaimer at the bottom. 
		User must accept the terms and conditions in order to view the experience.</p>

	<p>On the righthand side, customize how the user sees and interacts with the splash page.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>fixed mode</li>
			<li>center position</li>
			<li>block page</li>
			<li>alter the text size</li>
			<li>for Close options:
				<ul>
					<li>always show the window</li>
					<li>add type confirmation</li>
					<li>choose the style</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
