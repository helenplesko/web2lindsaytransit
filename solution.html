	<h1>Our Solution</h1>
</div>

<hr class="rounded">

<div class="pageintro">
    <h2>After lots of trial and error, we have found that Esri's ArcGIS Experience Builder is the best technology for a user-friendly public web application that will help people living and visiting Lindsay, Ontario, navigate around the city via public transit. Here's our methodology to create our final solution:</h2>
</div>

<hr class="rounded">

<div class="content">
	<h3>Step 1: Create an experience</h3>

	<p>Create an Experience using the ArcGIS Online component from the menu button. Click the Experience Builder app.</p>
	<img src="images/Template.png" alt="image of the experience builder">

	<p>Create a new Experience using the "Create New" button on the top righthand side.</p>
	<img src="images/template2.png" alt="creating a experience builder">

	<p>There will be many templates presented to you. Choose wisely for the application of your interest. In our case, we are creating a Transit application for Lindsay, so this application should be Map centric.</p>

	<h3>Step 2: Add data</h3>

	<p>Click on the map in the center of the screen, then add data from the "Select map" tab on the righthand side. 
		This enables users to add data from either ArcGIS Online or a local database.</p>
	<img src="images/template3.png" alt="Adding data">

	<p>After adding the data, you will see the stops and routes of the Lindsay transit in the application. 
		This routes features are what we created from the GTFS and Ontario GeoHub transit data.</p>
	<img src="images/template4.png" alt="Routes of Lindsay">

	<p> NOTE: Don't use the routing widget from the Experience builder as this requires credits and request per head. This is a useless function on this point.</p>
	<img src="images/route.png" alt="routing features1">

	<p> This causes a error at the final product this is the screen shot of that which we coundn't make that work.</p>
	<img src="images/routing.png" alt="routing features2">

	<h3>Step 3: Embed ArcGIS Dashboard</h3>

	<p>Using an "Embed" widget, Sharmila's ArcGIS Dashboard was embedded into the experience via a URL. You may be prompted to sign in to ArcGIS Online to view the Dashboard.</p>
	<img src="images/EBEmbed1.png" alt="embedding dashboard">

	<h3>Step 4: Add splash page</h3>

	<p>In the editing interface of the Experience Builder, click the page icon on the upper lefthand side of the sidebar.
		Click Window to switch to viewing all the windows within the experience. Click the + icon on the window to add a window.
	</p>
	<img src="images/EBSplash0.png" alt="add splash page">

	<p>Scroll down and choose your layout of choice of this window. I chose the Simple version. Give it a name and then click "Set as splash" icon next to the name.</p>

	<p>Add an image and text. On our splash page, we wanted to include an image of the routes and also text indicating what the purpose of the experience is. 
		Since this experience was for exploration purposes and the data needs some fine tuning, we added a disclaimer at the bottom. 
		User must accept the terms and conditions in order to view the experience.
		Customize the user experience with the splash page via the window on the righthand side.
	</p>
	<img src="images/EBSplash4.png" alt="splash page customization">

	<p>Now, when the experience is visited, this splash page will open up. 
		If the user does not accept terms and conditions, the checkbox will flash red, and they will not be able to see the experience until they click it. 
		If the user does accept the terms and conditions, they will see the experience.
	</p>
	<img src="images/EBSplash3.png" alt="splash page">

	<h3>Step 5: Add the Near Me widget</h3>

	<p>Click and drag the map centric "Map" widget to the experience interface and connect it to the Lindsay map added earlier. 
		Then click and drag the map centric "Near Me" widget to the experience interface and connect it to the map that was just added.</p>

	<p>Customize the Near Me widget using the settings below.</p>
	<img src="images/EBNearMe1.png" alt="near me widget custom">

	<p>Arrange both widgets where you see fit.</p>
	<img src="images/EBNearMe2.png" alt="experience with near me widget">

	<h3>Step 6: Review the Solution</h3>

	<p>After reviewing the solution, it was decided that the Dashboard was redundant. 
		It was visually appealing, but limited the interaction the user can have with the experience. 
		It also made the page look crowded. Therefore, it was removed.
		The tables from the Dashboard were added to the remaining space. This includes the table with Lindsay fare information and bus route schedules.

<h3>Although there are some tweaks that can make the experience better, it was decided that this was a suitable web solution for the issue we are trying to solve.</h3>
