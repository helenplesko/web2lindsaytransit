		<td>Super customizable, using API and SDK</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Has routing and geocoding processes</td>

    <tr>
		<td>Has an option to view the routes with 3D buildings, which can make travelling easier, as you can locate landmarks as you go</td>
		<td>In the free account, you have 50,000 free map loads for web - I am assuming we will go beyond this, especially when the map is made available to the public</td>
