    <h3>What is Dashboard?</h3>
</div>
<p>ArcGIS Dashboards conveys information by presenting a location based analytics and visualize interactive data on a single screen.ArcGIS Dashboards help in making decisions,visualizing trends and monitor status in real time . Dasboards are one of the most essential information products like apps contributing a significant part in geospatial infrastructure.</p>
<div class="pageintro">
    <h3>How did ArcGIS Dashboard helped us to find the solution?</h3>
</div>

<p>During the initial stage of problem resolving our team members discussed together that how the Dashboard can help us in building up a web application to for Lindsay transit.As Dashboard is one of the main contributor for accessing infrastructure building a transit app in dashboard was considered as a good option.There were some challenges and on the other hand there were also good outcomes from Dashboard that helped to find the ultimate solution.Some of our point of interests and challenges are given below.We started investigating about Dashboard in ArcGIS online and refered several dashboards in ArcGIS online to acquire some idea about it.The main steps that we followed to create a dashboard are given below. </p>

	<h3>Steps/Procedure we followed</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
		<li>Login to ArcGIS Online - User should have an account in Arcgis Online</li>
		<li>Go to ArcGIS Dashboard in ArcGIS Online , Click "Create Dashboard"</li>
		<li>Added the Map of Lindsay transit showing red, blue, green and orange bus routes and bus stops. </li>
		<li>In the Settings menu the scale bar settings were given and set the theme to dark or white. </li>
		<li>Added Splash screen to nofify and display the logo and a quick overview about the app. The element is modified and added to the final solution.</li>
	    <div class="output1">
			<!---added the image of splash screen--->
			<img src="images/splash.png" alt="splash screen output">
		</div>
		<li>Added four Lists in Dashboard displaying the name of the busstops and the corresponding time that the bus will reach in bus stop with a serach button.We tried to add a selection query in the dashboard but it didn't work so well. </li>
		<li>Then we added indicators </li>
		<div class="output2">
			<img src="images/indicators.png" alt="bus indicators">
		</div>
		<li>Added a table conatining the transit fares. </li>
		<div class="output3">
			<img src="images/table.png" alt="transit fares">
		</div>

	</ul> 
	<div class="pageintro">
		<h3>Challenges faced</h3>
	</div>
	<p>One of the main challenge was that we were not able to add a selection query to select the bus and bus route from the list element. It became less interactive when viewed from the point of technology. </p>
	<div class="output4">
		<img src="images/list.png" alt="list of bus routes">
	</div>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Advantages</th>
			<th>Disadvantages</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Can make dynamic elements, including indicators, pie charts, and lists</td>
			<td>Can be time consuming to create</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Tied to AGOL organization account</td>
			<td>Moving and sizing items can be finicky</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Can customize the theme/look</td>
			<td>Cannot easily move the published dashboards between accounts</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Minimal to no coding involved</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>It will automatically update for different screen sizes</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Can integrate with other apps, like Experience Builder</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<h3>Final prepared Dashboard</h3>
